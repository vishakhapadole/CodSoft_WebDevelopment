This repository contains the code for my CodSoft Web Development internship project, encompassing a portfolio website, a landing page, and a calculator application.
Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the portfolio showcases my skills and projects while providing contact information. 
The landing page serves to introduce visitors to a specific product, service, or idea. Additionally, the calculator application, implemented in JavaScript, allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
To explore the project, clone the repository, open the Task1.html file to view the portfolio and Task2.html to view the landing page, and access the Task3.html file for the calculator application.
